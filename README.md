# Menu Bar Spacer

A lightweight macOS utility to customize the spacing between menu bar icons. Built with Swift and SwiftUI.

## Overview
Ever feel like the macOS menu bar icons are too spread out (or too cramped)? This tool provides a simple graphical interface to adjust the `NSStatusItemSpacing` and `NSStatusItemSelectionPadding` global defaults without touching the Terminal.

## Features
* **Live Slider:** Choose a spacing value between 0 (tight) and 20 (wide).
* **Instant Refresh:** Automatically restarts `ControlCenter` to apply changes immediately.
* **Safety Reset:** A "Restore Default" button to get back to the standard macOS look instantly.

## Installation
1. Download the application from the [Dist](https://github.com/livelybride-faith/MenuBarSpacingController/blob/main/Dist/MenuBarSpacingController%202026-01-30%2013-00-28/MenuBarSpacingController.app/Contents/MacOS/MenuBarSpacingController) folder page.
2. Drag **Menu Bar Spacer** to your Applications folder (optional).
3. **Note:** Since this app is not notarized, you may need to right-click the app and select **Open** the first time you run it.

## Usage
1. Open the app.
2. Drag the slider to your preferred density.
3. Click **Apply Changes**. Your menu bar icons will disappear and reappear with the new spacing.

## Requirements
* macOS 12.0 or later.
* **Permissions:** This app requires the "App Sandbox" to be disabled (if building from source) so it can modify system defaults and refresh the Control Center.
